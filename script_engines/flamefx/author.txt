I have a fire demonstration effects program that I
wrote and I thought you might be interested in posting
it in your "Demo Effects" section in the Programming
section. It was written in C++ and demonstrates 8 fire
effects, has a easy to use interface, etc. If you
would like to check the program, it is attached as a
ZIP file.
