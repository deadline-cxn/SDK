             Copyright (c) Firelight Technologies, Pty, Ltd, 2004-2005
                              http://www.fmod.org
===============================================================================
	      + Added feature or noticable improvement
	      - Bug fix or something removed
	      * Changed or Information
===============================================================================

12/08/05 4.00.35
----------------

+ Added 64bit Linux (AMD64) support.
+ More VB examples.
+ Added 3D listener functions to EventSystem class.
+ Gamecube version available.
+ XCode projects added to examples in Mac release.
+ Added FMOD_DSP_ECHO_DRYMIX and FMOD_DSP_ECHO_WETMIX parameters to 
  echo filter.
+ Echo filter 20-30% faster.
+ Added support for special "3d distance" parameter in fmod_event 
  library.  Now you can specify envelopes in the fmod designer tool
  to react to 3d distance as the game runs!
+ Added http basic authentication support for icecast streams that have 
  listener authentication.

- Fixed Channel::setMode not updating loop mode on streams properly.
- Fixed Channel::setMute on channels not working when using FMOD_3D and 
  FMOD_SOFTWARE based sound.
- FSB bugfixes, including basicheaders support and ADPCM support.
- FMOD_INIT_DISABLESOFTWARE fixed.
- Fixed issues with creating and releasing new FMOD_SYSTEM/System objects 
  while streams were playing in an existing object.
- Fixed support for FMOD_DSP_TYPE_MIXER.
- Removed FMOD_DSP_ECHO_FEEDBACK.  Just use FMOD_DSP_ECHO_DECAYRATIO which
  does the same thing.
- Fixed System::close/release related hang if the user did not release 
  all channel groups they had created.

* Changed bitfield constants to #defines.  In C you can't define global
  constants because the C compiler doesn't regard const ints as compile time 
  constants.   C++ does, but we have to support both C and C++ :(

1/8/05 4.00.34
--------------

+ Added support for S9F effect (backwards playback) in .IT format.
+ Added DSP::setInputLevels / DSP::getInputLevels.
+ Added ChannelGroup::set3DAttributes.
+ Added dsp_effectperspeaker example.  This shows some DSP network
  manipulation.  A different dsp effect is put on each output speaker
  and only one sound is playing!
+ Added loadfrommemory example.  This just shows how to load a file from 
  memory rather than from disk.
+ Added FMOD_IGNORETAGS.  This enables the user to skip any redundant/extra 
  disc access if loading from a slow medium such as CD.

- Fixed VBR MP3s ending prematurely. (unless FMOD_ACCURATETIME was used).
- Fixed playlist example not loading files with relative paths.
- Fixed mac thread issue causing high cpu usage.
- Fixed linux compile issue.
- Fixed FMOD_OUTPUT_WAVWRITER on big endian platforms. (mac/xbox360/gc)
- Fixed WinMM output initialization on Windows 98.
- Fixed crash on XM files with bidi loops.
- Fixed mod, s3m & xm with speed = 0 freezing the mod playback,
  it is now ignored.
- Fixed MIDI issues, namely corrupted and badly written midi files!
- Removed stack overflow issue in MPEG codec.
- FMOD_NORMAL removed.  Just use FMOD_DEFAULT.
- Broken AAC libfaad support removed.  We will have to work out a 
  licensing agreement for the more improved libfaad2 before continuing 
  support for this again.

* FMOD Ex now has 27 examples!
* Changed bitfield enums to const ints so casting back to enum 
  type isn't needed when combining flags.

16/7/05 4.00.33 
---------------

FMOD Ex is now NON BETA.

+ Windows 64bit AMD64 build added!
+ Added good quality software reverb! FMOD_DSP_TYPE_REVERB.   
  Now FMOD_SOFTWARE mixed voices can have reverb, AND 5.1 output!
+ Added recording support to ESD output in linux.
+ Added ChannelGroup class.  This allows channels to be grouped for parameter
  control or effect submixing! (ie add an effect to a channel group)
+ Added channelgroups example.
+ Added submixing example.

- Fixed Sound::getName not working in v32 only.
- Hopefully last speaker issue fix.  WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE channelmask support
  is seriously broken on Creative and other sound cards.  Reasons:
  1.  Audigy NX bluescreens if you use WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE even for plain PCM,
      mono, 16bit data.
  2.  SBLive value reported to go silent if dwChannelMask is 0, even though the 
      Microsoft docs say 0 = direct out!
  3.  Even if you specify SPEAKER_STEREO as is recommended by Microsoft in 
      ksmedia.h, the panning biases towards the left on some cards.
  FMOD now only uses WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE for greater than stereo or 24/32bit 
  audio data.
- Fixed .S3M files with 16bit samples.
- Fixed .S3M files with stereo samples.
- Removed FMOD_CHANNEL_ALL.  To affect all channels use the new 
  System::getChannelGroup function which by default has all channels in 
  its group.
- Fixed MIDI playback with some bad files.
- Removed System::setMasterVolume / System::getMasterVolume.  To make master 
  volume use a System::getMasterChannelGroup then call ChannelGroup::setVolume.
- Removed Channel::setVolumeAbsolute.  To do this just create a new 
  ChannelGroup and add the channel to it that you don't want affected.

* System::playSound and System::playDSP change 'channelindex' parameter from
  'int' to encourage more people to use FMOD_CHANNEL_FREE instead of raw 
  channel indices.  To use a raw channel index you will have to cast the
  number to the FMOD_CHANNELINDEX type, making it an 'advanced' feature.
  If you are already using FMOD_CHANNEL_FREE you won't notice a difference.
* Visual Basic only.  FMOD_System_CreateSound now removes the exinfo param,
  and to pass it in a new function is created called FMOD_System_CreateSoundEx.
* FMOD_OUTPUT_GETDRIVERCAPSCALLBACK parameter list changed.
* Removed FMOD_OUTPUT_STARTCALLBACK.
* Removed FMOD_OUTPUT_STOPCALLBACK.

8/7/05 4.00.32 BETA
-------------------

+ Added winamp DSP plugin support.
+ Added WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE style 'channelmask' variable into 
  FMOD_CODEC_WAVEFORMAT.
+ Playlist support added. ASX, PLS. M3U and WAX.
  Added FMOD_SOUND_TYPE_PLAYLIST, FMOD_TAGTYPE_PLAYLIST.
+ Added Synchronization point API.  These points can come from markers 
  embedded in wav files, and can also generate channel callbacks.
    Sound::getNumSyncPoints
    Sound::getSyncPoint    
    Sound::getSyncPointInfo
    Sound::addSyncPoint    
    Sound::deleteSyncPoint
+ Added support for FMOD_CHANNEL_CALLBACKTYPE_SYNCPOINT.
+ Added FMOD_3D_LOGROLLOFF and FMOD_3D_LINEARROLLOFF.  Now you can
  treat min/max distance as volume = full and volume = 0 and FMOD 
  will linearly fade between them if you choose FMOD_3D_LINEARROLLOFF.

+ Multichannel WAV files with alternate/non default speaker mappings now 
  map the speaker output correctly into a sound created with FMOD_HARDWARE 
  under directsound.  FMOD_SOFTWARE based wavs are not affected at this time.

- Fixed 3rd party plugin support not seeking properly.
- Fixed createSound with no loop flags setting sound to loop instead of oneshot
  which should have been the default.
- Fixed playing a sample from an end callback crash.
- Speaker assignment fixes.
- Soundcreate callback in a codec being called properly now for a stream that 
  doesn't contain subsounds.
- Removed FMOD_MPEGHALFRATE.

* Renamed Channel::setOcclusion / getOcclusion to set3DOcclusion / set3DOcclusion
  so that it groups better with the other functions.
* Shuffled channel and sound class functions around a bit to be more logical.

24/6/05 4.00.31 BETA
-------------------

+ Added FMOD_ERR_MEMORY_IOP, FMOD_ERR_MEMORY_SRAM.
+ Better AIFF support including AIFC (non compressed).
+ More documentation.  API reference now 'complete'.  More refining and 
  additions most likely need to be made!

- Fixed pcmreadcallback in user streams not passing in the right sound pointer.
- Fixed ogg vorbis not playing as a netstream.
- Removed 'subsound' from FMOD_CODEC_GETPOSITIONCALLBACK.
- Fixed Channel::setPosition inconsitancy when calling this function 2 times 
  very quickly next to each other
- Error checked getWaveData and getSpectrum for channeloffset being larger than
  number of channels.

9/6/05 4.00.30 BETA
-------------------

+ Added FMOD_TIMEUNIT_MODPATTERN.
+ Added API documentation to Geometry class.

- Fixed mod/s3m/xm/it/midi crash.
- Fixed C# dsp effect enum list.
- Fixed FMOD_CHANNEL_REUSE bug.  (and therefore the generatetone example)
- Fixed stream flushing its buffer twice sometimes.
- Fixed some strange cases of stream playback causing new streams to play 
  silent.
- Removed FMOD_DSP_TYPE_FFT that didn't actually do anything?  Maybe later.

6/6/05 4.00.29 BETA
-------------------

+ GameCube support added.
+ XBox 360 support added.
+ Tags embedded in http based streams now work! (As long as they are at the 
  start of the file)
+ Sound::getName now returns name of sound by using tags or embedded song name.
+ Added name field to FMOD_CODEC_WAVEFORMAT.
+ Added Sound::setSubSoundSentence.  Gapless stream playback is now available!
+ Added FMOD_ERR_ALREADYLOCKED.
+ Added DirectX 3 support for FMOD software mixing only, so that pre-dx8 stuff
  like VirtualPC don't fail.
+ Added 'decodebuffersize' to FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO.
+ Increased code name size from 32 bytes to 256 bytes.
+ Added "Real-time stitching" example.
+ Added ability to create user sounds with subsounds.
+ More documentation.
+ .it loader several times faster on songs with stereo samples in them.
+ Added FMOD_TIMEUNIT_SENTENCE_MS, FMOD_TIMEUNIT_SENTENCE_PCM, 
  FMOD_TIMEUNIT_SENTENCE_PCMBYTES, FMOD_TIMEUNIT_SENTENCE,
  FMOD_TIMEUNIT_SENTENCE_SUBSOUND and FMOD_TIMEUNIT_BUFFERED.
+ Added System::setSoftwareChannels / System::getSoftwareChannels instead of
  setting it in System::init.

- Fixed memory leak in createsound/stream if 'file not found'.
- Fixed memory leak in createsound/stream if 'format not recognized'.
- Fixed sub-sounds (ie CDDA, DLS or FSB) not displaying their names.
- Fixed crash on certain .IT files.
- Fixed silent samples on .S3M files.
- Fixed bpm issue on .S3M files.
- Fixed file offset bug.
- Fixed Channel::getWaveData not working for streams.
- Fixed certain mp3 netstreams with large amounts of redundant crap at the 
  start.
- Fixed Channel::setMode not taking effect on software based channels.
- Fixed Channel::getPosition flickering on userstreams and maybe rare cases
  on normal streams.
- Fixed System::setFileSystem.
- Fixed FMOD_CHANNEL_REUSE now returns same handle value instead of reference counting it.
- Fixed (XBOX only) pausing related bug.
- Fixed Streams hanging/crashing after 24 hours of playback.
- Removed 'levels' from Sound::setDefaults.
- Removed 'levels' from DSP::setDefaults.
- Removed Channel::getLevels.  Just use Channel::getWaveData(level, 1, 0) 
  instead.  Also you could use larger values than 1 and scan the array
  for the largest value, or maybe average them out.
- Removed Channel::setNextSound / getNextSound.
- Removed FMOD_OPENSTATE_LOADINGSUBSOUND.
- Removed numsoftwarechannels from System::init.
- Removed System::setMaxInputChannels / System::getMaxInputChannels.  This is now a 
  paramater to System::setSoftwareFormat / System::getSoftwareFormat.

* Sounds with multiple subsounds (CDDA/FSB/DLS etc) when opened as streams
  now play as one long sentence containing every subsound, if the parent
  sound is played.  To play just the first subsound, the user can call
  parentsound->getSubSound(0, &subsound); and play the subsound.
* Changed end callback behaviour to callback only when a sound ends,
  and not when stopped by the user.
* If FMOD_CREATESAMPLE is used with mod/s3m/xm/it, and FMOD_ACCURATETIME is not,
  accurate time is forced so that it doesn't just fail with FMOD_ERR_MEMORY.
* Changed FMOD_FILE_SEEKCALLBACK to only support offset.  SEEK_CUR and SEEK_END 
  are pointless, FMOD works it out and always gives an absolute offset to the user.
* Changed System::setStreamBufferSize / System::getStreamBufferSize parameters.  
  Removed 'decodebuffersize'.  (now in FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO)
* Changed FMOD_TIMEUNIT_ORDER to FMOD_TIMEUNIT_MODORDER.
* Changed FMOD_TIMEUNIT_ROW to FMOD_TIMEUNIT_MODROW.
* Renamed CDDA example to cdplayer.  Updated some of the code and comments inside.
* Changed System::setMinMaxHWChannels to System::setHardwareChannels.
* Changed System::getNumHWChannels to System::getHardwareChannels.  Note! num2d
  and num3d parameters have been swapped around.
* Changed System::setOutputPlugin   / System::getOutputPlugin to 
          System::setOutputByPlugin / System::getOutputByPlugin
* Changed System::setOutputFormat / System::getOutputFormat to 
          System::setSoftwareFormat / System::getSoftwareFormat and added a 
          maxinputchannels parameter.
* Changed FMOD_OUTPUT_INITCALLBACK to use void *extradriverdata instead of
  const void *hwnd.


9/5/05 4.00.28 BETA
-------------------

+ Added 'userdata' member to FMOD_DSP_DESCRIPTION structure.

- Fixed FMOD_OPENMEMORY not working after beta 27 file offset change.
- Removed FMOD_DSP structure.
- Fixed pointer in DSP callbacks not being the same as the one created with.

6/5/05 4.00.27 BETA
-------------------

+ Added 'controlpanelspeakermode' to System::getDriverCaps.
+ Added C# and VB versions of the 'effects' example.

- Fixed sounds returning invalid handle if a system object was released 
  then re-created.
- Fixed Sound::seekData giving wrong results.
- Fixed file offset / length bug in System::createSound.
- Fixed sounds with no FMOD_SOFTWARE or FMOD_HARDWARE specified crashing
  when being swapped out in a virtual channel.

* Changed System::getDriverCaps to add an extra parameter.
* Changed FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_NONE to FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_RAW.
* Changed FMOD_OUTPUT_GETDRIVERCAPSCALLBACK to return the platform specific 
  speaker setting based on the control panel or operating system.

3/5/05 4.00.26 BETA
-------------------

+ Implemented Sound::setLoopCount / Sound::getLoopCount and 
  Channel::setLoopCount / Channel::getLoopCount.  Works on static samples
  as well as streams!
+ Added FSBankEXlib.  Available in Multithreaded, and Multithreaded DLL builds.
+ Added a few more docs.

- Fixed DSP crash on DSP units played with System::playDSP.
- Fixed handling of wav files with bad and corrupted loop points stored within
  them.

2/5/05 4.00.25 BETA
-------------------

+ Added FSBankEx.  FSBankEx uses the FMOD Ex engine for loading, so it could
  support file format plugins.  It also supports multichannel wavs when 
  encoding multichannel interleaved FSB files!  (no more needing 6 mono wavs 
  or 3 stereo wavs for a 5.1 fsb.  Just one 6 channel wav/ogg etc will work).
+ Added FSB encryption.  Now sound designers can 'mangle' their data files
  and only with the correct key on the application side will the correct
  data be playable.
+ Sound::setLoopPoints / getLoopPoints and Channel::setLoopPoints / 
  getLoopPoints fully implmented for samples and streams.  FMOD_HARDWARE
  sounds that are samples do not support this.
+ Added makefile to linux release, to allow for "make install".

- Fixed Channel functions returning invalid handle error from channel end 
  callbacks.
- Fixed close crash when reusing a channel that was playing a DSP unit.
- Fixed handling of truncated wav files.
- Fixed delphi headers.

* Documentation cleanups, mainly in the 'get' functions.


28/4/05 4.00.24 BETA
--------------------

+ Added Channel::setNextSound.  This allows a channel to switch from one
  sound to another mid playback without gaps.  Currently disabled.
+ FMOD_CREATESAMPLE added to FMOD_FLAGS to force codecs that open as a stream 
  by default now (mod/s3m/xm/it/midi) to load as a sample.

- Fixed streams smaller than the file buffer size playback bug.
- Fixed Channel::setOcclusion.
- Fixed Channel::setVolumeAbsolute.
- Changed VB header's boolean types to Int to be more binary compatible with 
  the FMOD dll.

* Changed mod/s3m/xm/it/midi to load as a stream by default even when you 
  call createSound.  To many people are trying to decode whole mod files into
  memory and wondering why they run out of memory.  
  To force the 'decode into memory' behaviour, the new FMOD_CREATESAMPLE can 
  be used.
* Changed channel handle passed into channel callbacks from being different 
  from channel handle returned from playsound, to be the same.

21/4/05 4.00.23 BETA
--------------------

- Fixed file system bug.
- Fixed crash when calling play or setposition when a stream was playing.

20/4/05 4.00.22 BETA
--------------------

- Fixed virtual voice swap callback.  Voices that are real now also get a 
  callback when you first set the callback so you can accurately track which 
  start off real and which start off virtual, then what happens after that.
- Fixed channel end callback.  Voices that were stolen/reused before 
  System::update was called weren't getting their callback.
- Improved channel selector to stop it stealing playing channels if other 
  channels had just stopped (and System::update hadn't been called yet).

19/4/05 4.00.21 BETA
--------------------

+ Added backwards playback support.  Negative setfrequency is accepted with
  FMOD_SOFTWARE sounds only, and samples (not streams) only.
+ Added FMOD_SOUND_NONBLOCKCALLBACK callback to FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO
  to allow a user to get a callback when a sound has finished loading.  
  Used with FMOD_NONBLOCKING flag.  Error code is passed in as a parameter.
+ Added DSP::setBypass / DSP::getBypass.  This allows the user to disable
  the effect of a dsp unit, without stopping all of its inputs, like 
  DSP::setActive would.

- Macintosh thread usage changed from Carbon to Posix for mach-o build.
  Now streams wont stutter when using the OSX gui!
- Fixed a lot of crashes to do with virtual voices and streams.  (not 
  nescessarily combined).  This should be a LOT more stable now.
- Fixed squelching/chirping on mp3s and file errors on other formats.
- Fixed stream stuttering on certain machines/file formats by increasing
  stream decode buffersize default from 200ms to 400ms.
- System::createSound now correctly returns FMOD_ERR_FILENOTFOUND instead of 
  FMOD_ERR_FORMAT when failing to open the file.
- Fixed FMOD_NONBLOCKING causing a memory leak and not working if the sound 
  was a static sample.

* Changed System::setStreamBufferSize / System::getStreamBufferSize so user 
  can now specify the decode buffer size and file buffer size separately.
* Stream default file buffersize reduced from 64k to 16k to save memory.
  For net streams/cdda, 64k or so would be recommended.


13/4/05 4.00.20 BETA
--------------------

+ Added Sound::set3DConeSettings / Sound::get3DConeSettings
        Channel::set3DConeSettings / Channel::get3DConeSettings
        Channel::set3DConeOrientation / Channel::get3DConeOrientation.
+ Increased speed of virtual voice swapping when going from emulated<->real.

- Fixed FMOD_SOFTWARE + FMOD_3D and streams not working.
- Fixed crash in System::update if virtual channels were being swapped that
  were streams.
- Fixed FMOD_OPENONLY crash if stream was started with no seek.
- Fixed bug in System::getNumDrivers if it was called after System::init
  without having called System::getNumDrivers or System::getDriverName 
  before System::init first.  (FMOD
- Removed Geometry::flush.  Use System::update.
- Fixed glitch in filesytem causing WMA to fail opening and WAV to click.
- Added protection for if a user reads all of a file with Sound::readData
  then mistakenly starts the stream looping, causing a hang.
- Fixed crash when releasing a stream while it was playing.
- Fixed delphi header mistakes.

8/4/05 4.00.19 BETA
-------------------

+ Added buffer underrun detection!  No more stream stuttering!  You can
  now detect when underrun occurs and mute the stream or do whatever you 
  want with it.  Netstream example has been updated to reflect this.
+ Added Geometry::save to save out an object to a binary format.
+ Added System::loadGeometry to load an object from a binary format.
+ Added recording support for FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_COREAUDIO on mac.
+ Added some documentation.

- Fixed stream crash.

* Changed Sound::getOpenState to also have 'percentbuffered' and 'starving'
  parameters.  This is good for watching network streams buffer and also
  for error handling when a stream is starved.  
* Changed System::setStreamBufferSize to pass unsigned int instead of int.
* Changed System::getStreamBufferSize to pass unsigned int * instead of int *
  and now the sizetype is a pointer.
* Changed FMOD_DSP_SEEKCALLBACK to FMOD_DSP_SETPOSITIONCALLBACK.

5/4/05 4.00.18 BETA
-------------------

+ New streaming code to hugely reduce memory usage compared to FMOD 3, and
  also remove cpu 'spikes'.  FMOD now has a smooth consistant cpu usage while
  streaming, and uses a fraction of the memory that it used to for compressed
  formats.
+ Sound::getOpenState now returns an error code that reflects what went 
  wrong in the async open thread (FMOD_NONBLOCKING) if there was an error.
+ Updated netstream example to show new openstate functionality.
+ Added 'userdata' member to FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO.  This allows the use
  of Sound::getUserData when getting pcmreadcallback and pcmsetposcallback
  during System::createSound.
+ Added overloaded System::createSound to C# so FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO isn't
  needed if not wanted.
+ Added recording support for FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_SOUNDMANAGER on mac.

- Fixed Sound::getOpenState not returning FMOD_OPENSTATE_CONNECTING or 
  FMOD_OPENSTATE_BUFFERING.
- Fixed crash in System::close if user tried to released a sound that was
  still in the middle of opening with FMOD_NONBLOCKING.
- Stopped denormalized floats getting into the lowpass/highpass/eq filters
  causing huge cpu usage or exceptions.
- Removed FMOD_FILE_TELLCALLBACK.
- Fixed MP3 codec so that it doesnt skip the first frame or take extra time
  than it needs to.
- Fixed speaker levels not working because 3D code was resetting the levels
  on 2D sounds.
- Fixed FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO not being used in FMOD_NONBLOCKING created
  sounds, making things like non-blocking memory load calls fail.
- Fixed MinGW and CygWin linking errors on windows.

* Changed FMOD_FILE_OPENCALLBACK to add filesize parameter.  This is better
  than having FMOD do a seek end, tell, then seek 0, because the length might
  already be present in a TOC or other filesystem structure.
* Changed System::setFileSystem to remove FMOD_FILE_TELLCALLBACK.
* Changed 'filelength' to 'length' in FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO.
* Changed FMOD_CODEC to remove FMOD_FILE_TELLCALLBACK filetell.
* Changed FMOD_CODEC to provide filesize.

1/4/05 4.00.17 BETA
-------------------

+ Added "FMOD Designer" sound tool.
+ Added multichannel output support to Mac build for surround sound.
  (FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_COREAUDIO only).
+ Added recording support to ALSA and OSS modes on linux.
+ Added VBR Xing header support.  Now Xing encoded MP3's won't need 
  FMOD_ACCURATETIME to get accurate seeking and length of VBR mp3's.
+ Added fmodex_bc.lib import library for borland C.  C++ linking not supported.
+ Added libfmodex.a import library for MinGW/CygWin.  C++ linking not supported.
+ Implemented setMinMaxHWChannels.
+ Added Channel::getAudiblity.  This is just the audible volume of the channel
  by multiplying 3d volume, volume, master volume and geometry occlusion 
  together.
+ Added FMOD_TIMEUNIT_RAWBYTES for Sound::getLength and Channel::getPosition
  only.
+ More functions documented, still not there yet!

- Fixed Virtual voice support for static sounds and streams.
- Fixed race condition on Channel::setPan which causes NaN's and sound 
  dropping out.  (FMOD_SOFTWARE only).
- Removed Channel::setTime / getTime.  Use Channel::setPosition / getPosition
  with FMOD_TIMEUNIT_MS instead.
- Tremor fixed point ogg vorbis codec removed.
- Fixed linux build not running in anything but root mode.
- Fixed crash on bidi/pingpong music loops in samples.
- Fixed stereo sounds not loading as FMOD_3D like they used to. 
  (they automatically downmix to mono as they stream or load.)
- VirtualVoices example memory GDI memory leak fixed.
- Fixed divide by 0 in highpass and bandpass and possibly lowpass filters.
- Removed FMOD_INIT_DSOUND_GLOBALFOCUS.  Now it is global by default, and you
  specify a hwnd if you don't want it global.
- Fixed sounds with subsounds and Sound::seekData seeking to entry 0 each time
  instead of the entry they are supposed to be associated with.
- 8bit PCM wav streams/sound loading - huge speedup.

* Changed pan from 0.0 -> 1.0 to -1.0 -> +1.0.
* Changed distance factor to reflect documentation.  Currently it was taking 
  1/3.28 for feet instead of 3.28 as it should have.
* Min and Max distance now defaults to distance factor when a sound is created.
* Changed setMinMaxHWChannels changed from int min, int max to 
  int min2d, int max2d, int min3d, int max3d.
* Changed FMOD_VBRACCURATE to FMOD_ACCURATETIME.  Now MOD/S3M/XM/IT can share
  this flag.  FMOD will quickly and quitely play the mod until it finds the same
  point in the song again (a where the song loops) and count that as the length
  of the song.
* Changed Sound::getLength to use position and FMOD_TIMEUNIT parameter instead
  of 3 hardcoded ms, pcm, pcmbytes values.  This now allows things like number
  of mod/s3m/xm/ut orders in a song to be reported for example.
* Changed 3D example to have changable distance factor.


3/3/05 4.00.16 ALPHA
---------------------

+ Added more tutorials to documentation.
+ Added WinMM recording to FMOD_OUTPUT_WINMM output mode.
+ Added VST plugin support.
+ Added System::lockDSP and System::unlockDSP in case the user wants to stop 
  FMOD's dsp engine while doing a complex dsp network adjustment (ie moving
  multiple units around and disconnecting / connecting).
+ Implemented System::getHandle for all platforms.
+ Added System::createDSPByIndex.
+ Added DSP::setParameter / getParameter.
+ Added DSP::getNumParameters.
+ Added DSP::getParameterInfo.
+ Added DSP::showConfigDialog.
+ Added DSP::getInfo.
+ Added dsp_gain example to show how to write a simple DSP plugin.
+ Added effect example to show how to use FMOD's built in effects.
+ Added dspviewer example to show how to use dynamic plugins, and also
  draw a spectrum and waveform using System::getSpectrum, System::getWaveData.
+ Added System::getWaveData / Channel::getWaveData for plotting the 
  waveform of the playing audio.  Much simpler than creating a dsp unit etc.

- Fixed ParamEQ filter and also fixed a heap of other filters to be more 
  tolerant of extreme parameters.
- Removed Channel::setWeight / getWeight.
- Removed 'weight' from DSP::setDefaults / getDefaults.
- Removed 'weight' from Sound::setDefaults / getDefaults.
- Removed DSP::setParameters / getParameters.
- Removed System::getDSP.

- Fixed stream thread shutting down if second System object was created then 
  closed.
- Fixed record system getting out of sync if recordStop then recordStart were

  written rather than number of samples being analyzed. (which is always 2x the data 
  written to the buffer)

27/1/05 4.00 alpha 15
---------------------

+ Added Geometry API.  
+ Added IASIG I3DL2 Reverb support.  Now some non EAX compatible cards can get
  hardware reverb with the same fmod interface!.
+ Added Echo effect.  (FMOD_DSP_TYPE_ECHO, FMOD_DSP_PARAM_ECHO)
+ Added Flange effect.  (FMOD_DSP_TYPE_FLANGE, FMOD_DSP_PARAM_FLANGE)
+ Added Distortion effect.  (FMOD_DSP_TYPE_DISTORTION, FMOD_DSP_PARAM_DISTORTION)

+ Added virtual voices example.
+ Added geometry example.
+ Added System::createStream.  This is identical to System::createSound but
  just with the FMOD_CREATESTREAM flag added in.  It is to make it more obvious
  so people don't go loading huge files into memory when they should be 
  streamed by accident.
+ Added System::createStream which is exactly the same as System::createSound
  but with the FMOD_CREATESTREAM mode bit added in, because I know people are
  going to forget to add the flag unless it is right in front of them!
+ Added Visual Basic interface.

- Fixed DSP related issues with units having multiple outputs.
- Removed "outputfrequency" from FMOD_DSP_PARAM_LOWPASS
- Removed "outputfrequency" from FMOD_DSP_PARAM_LOWPASS2
- Removed "outputfrequency" from FMOD_DSP_PARAM_OSCILLATOR
- Priority and weight now work.
- Voices are now swapped based on volume and 3d volume.
- Fixed FMOD_SOFTWARE based 3d sounds appearing loud between System::playSound
  when paused and System::update if the sound was positioned far away.

* Renamed "wetness" parameter in DSP::setInputMix to "volume".

6/1/05 4.00.14 ALPHA
--------------------

+ Added EAX2, EAX3 and EAX4 support.  If the card supports EAX4, multiple 
  reverb environments at once are possible.
+ Added 2 lowpass resonance filters. (FMOD_DSP_TYPE_LOWPASS, FMOD_DSP_TYPE_LOWPASS2)
+ .IT music support now supports resonant lowpass filtering.
+ Added FMOD_INIT_DISABLESOFTWARE to save memory if software mixing isn't 
  needed.
+ Added FMOD_ERR_NEEDSSOFTWARE if a codec or feature is used that requires 
  software mixing.
+ Added missing codec_dls.dll to make the plugin version of codec_midi.dll work.
  DLS files can also be loaded without MIDI as well like a multi-sound bank and 
  Sound::getSubSound can be used to play or get information on each sound.
+ Added System::addDSP.
+ Added Channel::addDSP.
+ Added FMOD_ERR_DSP_TOOMANYCONNECTIONS.
+ Added DSP::remove to unlink DSP effects added with System::addDSP or 
  Channel::addDSP
+ Added maxpolyphony to FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO structure to reduce memory/cpu
  consumption on formats like mod/s3m/xm/it/midi if they use dynamic channel
  allocation. (currently only .it and .mid do this)
+ Added DSP::reset to allow a user to reuse a filter but to reset it to its 
  initial state.
+ Added FMOD_DSP_RESETCALLBACK to FMOD_DSP_DESCRIPTION structure.
+ Added System::isRecording
+ Enabled Channel::getSpectrum

- Fixed midi codec crash if 0 software channels were specified.
- Fixed click on end of one shot samples in FMOD_SOFTWARE mode.
- Fixed small memory leak in .IT codec.
- Fixed System::close crash.
- Fixed corruption in mp3 codec.
- Fixed loop point clicking on PCM based hardware sounds on XBox.
- Fixed min and max 3d distance being ignored on XBox.
- Fixed streams not allowing 3d attributes or mode to be changed.

* changed System::loadPlugin parameters.
* changed System::createDSPByID to System::createDSPByType
* changed FMOD_DSP_DESCRIPTION::type to FMOD_DSP_DESCRIPTION::category
* changed FMOD_DSP_TYPE to FMOD_DSP_CATEGORY
* changed FMOD_DSP_ID to FMOD_DSP_TYPE
* changed FMOD_DSP_READCALLBACK length parameter from a pointer to a normal int.
* MOD/S3M/XM/IT panning made linear to sound more spatialized, and more like 
  modplug tracker which doesnt use constant power panning like it should.
* Changed System::recordStart to add a bool loop parameter.
* Changed mod/s3m/xm/it/midi to target FMOD_SOUND_FORMAT_PCM16 instead of 
  FMOD_SOUND_FORMAT_PCMFLOAT if FMOD_HARDWARE is specified.
* Changed FMOD_DSP_FFT_WINDOW_TYPE to FMOD_DSP_FFT_WINDOW

17/12/04 4.00.13 ALPHA
----------------------

- Fixed FMOD_INIT_3D_RIGHTHANDED flag.
- MIDI plugin corruption fixed.
- Fixed C version of ripnetstream.
- Clarified mode flags.  Now FMOD_2D and FMOD_HARDWARE are default.  
  FMOD_3D always overrides FMOD_2D and FMOD_SOFTWARE always overrides FMOD_HARDWARE.
- AAC will now open in a non accurate CBR calculation mode like MP3 does.  Use
  FMOD_VBRACCURATE to get an accurate System::getLength / System::setTime.

* To use fmodexp.dll in C# use the new fmodp.cs.  It is the same as fmod.cs 
  it just refers to a different DLL.


16/12/04 4.00.12 ALPHA
----------------------

+ Added DLS MIDI support!  FMOD Ex now has its own native cross platform MIDI
  playback codec which does not rely on any external libraries such as 
  DirectMusic.  DLS 1 spec is now supported.  SF2 will come later.
+ Added AAC support.
+ Added C# Interface and examples!
+ Added FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO structure to go with new System::createSound.
+ Added / Renamed some init flags to FMOD_INIT_DSOUND_GLOBALFOCUS, 
  FMOD_INIT_DSOUND_DEFERRED, FMOD_INIT_DSOUND_HRTFNONE, 
  FMOD_INIT_DSOUND_HRTFLIGHT, FMOD_INIT_DSOUND_HRTFFULL.
+ Added FMOD_UNICODE to mode flags to allow unicode filenames to load.
+ FMOD_3D + FMOD_SOFTWARE now supports multi-speaker output!  Use 
  System::setSpeakerMode first of course.
+ Added System::setSpeakerPosition.
+ Added System::getSpeakerPosition.
  These 2 functions allow you to physically describe the location of your
  speakers and FMOD will skew panning based on this when in 3D!
+ Added FMOD_CAPS_HARDWARE_EMULATED flag.
+ System::getDriverCaps implemented.
+ Documented a lot more functions, and added "TERMINOLOGY / BASIC CONCEPTS"
  page to the documentation.
+ Implemented System::getOutputHandle
+ Implemented System::setRecordDriver
+ Implemented System::getRecordDriver
+ Implemented System::getRecordNumDrivers
+ Implemented System::getRecordDriverName
+ Added System::getRecordHandle
+ Added recordStart
+ Added recordStop
+ Added recordGetPosition

- Removed System::createSoundEx
- min/max distance working properly for hardware 3d sounds.
- multispeaker stuff for hardware 3d sounds working again.
- Fixed Channel::setPan not working on hardware 2d DirectSound buffers.
- Fixed divide by 0 crash if a codec set the blockalign to 0.
- Removed FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_PROLOGIC2 and made FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_PROLOGIC use
  Prologic 2 encoding by default.  It will work on a Prologic 1 decoder as 
  well so having 2 is redundant.
- Fixed multichannel sound not working on some soundcards.
- Fixed .it pitch envelope bug.
- Removed FMOD_CREATESTATIC flag.  This is the default behaviour anyway.
- Removed FMOD_OPENRECORD flag.
- Fixed Sound::readData not reading 100% of the file.

* Renamed FMOD_MPEGACCURATE to FMOD_VBRACCURATE so more VBR formats that dont
  store their PCM sample length somewhere can use this flag (like AAC)
* Changed parameters in System::createSound to take a pointer to a 
  FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO structure.  To behave like the old System::createSound
  just pass 0 or NULL as this parameter.
* Worked around a bluescreen bug in creative labs driver due to them not 
  supporting WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE properly.
* Delphi header updated.

10/11/04 4.00.11 ALPHA
----------------------

+ Added output plugin support!  Now users can add their own output modes for 
  FMOD Ex to software mix into.
+ Added DSound plugin.
+ Added WinMM support and plugin.
+ Added ASIO support and plugin.
+ Added NoSound support and plugin.
+ Added WavWriter support and plugin.  Supports multichannel and multiformat
  wav files (ie 6 channel 32bit floating point wavs can be written from the
  FMOD mixer output).  Supply a filename through 'hwnd' parameter.
+ Added System::setOutputPlugin / System::getOutputPlugin
+ Added System::getNumPlugins, System::getPluginInfo, System::unloadPlugin.
+ Added plugins/output_mp3 example.  Uses lame_enc.dll.  Realtime output of 
  FMOD Ex is encoded and written to an mp3 file!
+ System::setSpeakerMode now sets output channel count to appropriate value.
+ Channel::setSpeakerMix / Channel::getSpeakerMix / Channel::setSpeakerLevels /
  Channel::setSpeakerLevels added / implemented.
+ System::setMasterVolume now ignores absolute channels set with 
  Channel::setVolumeAbsolute properly.
+ Added useplugins example.
+ Added multispeakeroutput example.
+ A bit more documentation added.

- Fixed crash in certain .IT songs.
- MOD, S3M, XM, IT plugins now about 8k smaller.
- fmodexp.dll now 5k smaller due to Directsound Output being moved into plugin.
- removed limitation on 2d directsound buffers using same min/max frequency 
  limitation as 3d directsoundbuffers.
- Invalid handles for channels that have stopped or been stolen now return 
  0 false or null in information functions to reduce accidental user bugs.

24/10/04 4.00.10 ALPHA
----------------------

+ Added .S3M codec.  Supports total click removal, 3D S3Ms, S3M as samples, 
  100% accuate length calculation etc.
+ Added .XM / .OXM (ogg XM) codec.  Supports total click removal, 3D XMs, 
  XM as samples, 100% accuate length calculation etc.
+ Added .IT codec.  Supports total click removal, 3D ITs, IT as samples, 
  100% accuate length calculation etc.
+ Enabled FMOD_LOOP_BIDI support for software voices.
+ Added ability to let user decide what buffer format and frequency MOD/S3M/XM/IT 
  should decode to.  By default it is the same as the output frequency and 
  FMOD_SOUND_FORMAT_PCMFLOAT.   Simply specify a sound format and/or frequency 
  in System::createSoundEx.
+ Added 'multiplesoundcard' example to show easy multiple sound card support.

- Removed click on looping FMOD_SOFTWARE samples from loopstart.
- Removed random crackles from MOD/S3M/XM/IT support due to thread concurrency
  issue.
- Fixed Sound::setMode forcing sound to 3D if FMOD_2D or FMOD_3D wasn't 
  specified.
- Fixed Sound::getLength support for large files returning the wrong value.  
  WAV and AIFF were affected.
- Fixed crash on Sound::release with sounds with tags that werent created as a 
  stream.
- Worked around a DirectSound bug (hello Microsoft!).  IEEE 32bit floating point
  buffers set to volume 0 would make a horrible buzzing noise.  Changed dsound
  code to be 'almost silent' but not quite for float buffers, but to users ears
  it will be silent.  Seemed to only happen if playback buffer frequency is the 
  same as the frequnecy the source buffer was created in.
- Fixed crash on FMOD_SOFTWARE based sounds being played at extremely high speeds 
  and with small loops.
- Fixed Directsound enumeration only enumerating 1 device.
- Updated RAW codec plugin example.

* Changed FMOD_CODEC_OPENCALLBACK to take in usermode, userfrequency, userformat.
  These parameters allow the codec to know what the user passed in via 
  Sound::createSound
* System::getNumDrivers and System::getDriverName now allowed to be called after
  System::init.

15/10/04 4.00.09 ALPHA
----------------------

+ Added .MOD codec.  Improvements on FMOD 3 include.
  - Click free!  Clicks from sounds that cut each other off on the same 
    MOD channel are removed, for 100% click removal.
  - Sound::getLength gives the exact length of a MOD in milliseconds no matter 
    what!  Even backwards, infinite, or complicated looping MODs are no challenge.  
  - Channel::setPosition / Channel::setTime allows sample accurate seeking
    into a MOD, by time.  FMOD 3 only allowed seeking by 'MOD order'.
  - MODs can be loaded as a sample!  You can load a mod as a sample, then grab 
    the PCM buffer using Sound::lock/Sound::unlock and write it to a .wav file if 
    you want!
  - MODs can be played on hardware voices!
  - MODs can be played in 3D!  They can be panned, volume scaled or even 
    frequency adjusted.  They can do anything a normal stream could do.

- Removed click when FMOD_SOFTWARE based sound had its volume set to 0.
- Plugged DirectSound memory leak.

7/10/04 4.00.08 ALPHA
---------------------

+ Added System::playDSP added.  Now tone generator DSP units can be played 
  instantly without having to do any DSP network connection / disconnection.
+ Memory usage dropped by about 42kb.  After System::init with 100 virtual 
  voices and software mixing turned off, total memory usage is about 54kb.
+ Updated ripnetstream example.  Rip shoutcast etc radio stations to mp3 files!
  Supports Artist / Title tag broadcasts to name each mp3 by.
+ Added generatetone example.  Shows how to play generated sounds without
  loading a sample!
+ Added FMOD_CHANNEL_REUSE so a channel can be re-used instead of a new 
  channel being selected.  The channel re-used is the one passed into 
  System::playSound / System::playDSP.
+ Added FMOD_CHANNEL_ALL support.  Use System::getChannel and use this 
  handle as a channel handle that will affect all channels.
+ 'dataoffsetbytes' parameter implemented for System::createSoundEx.
+ Added FMOD_MPEGSEARCH so FMOD will search right through an MP3 for a correct 
  header if the file is corrupt.  By default it searches for 4096 bytes 
  then gives up.

- Fatal net stream errors now terminate stream playback.
- Fixed System::attachFileSystem not being present in import library.
- Fixed Sound::getFormat not returning the correct sound type.
- Fixed netstreams always ending after about 137 minutes.
- Fixed clicking/crackling if a filter DSP callback tried to change 
  the output length/channels.  Filter units can now not change the length 
  or channels going out.

* Net tags that don't contain any new information (such as regular shoutcast 
  title/artist broadcasts that get transmitted every few seconds) are now 
  ignored.  New tags are only available via FMOD if they are in fact 
  unique.  Saves end user having to do string compares in their own app.
* DirectSound volume and panning now smoother / more accurate.


1/10/04 4.00.07 ALPHA
---------------------

+ Multi-channel ogg supported.
+ Added System::attachFileSystem to 'ride' on top of FMOD's file calls.
+ Added 'ripnetstream' example to show how to rip a stream from a url
  to a file using System::attachFileSystem.

- vorbis comment corruption causing ogg problems fixed.
- Fixed non seekable streams such as internet streams trying to loop or 
  exhibiting weird behaviour if System::playSound while it was already 
  or System::setTime.
- Small streams (streams smaller than the stream buffersize) not 
  restarting fixed.
- Multichannel sounds playing on stereo output are now not scaled down
  by the number of channels and just played at full volume.
- Fixed click at end of software based sounds when playing more than 1
  at once.


28/09/04 4.00.06 ALPHA
----------------------

+ Added System::getSpectrum.  This spectrum analysis function is FAR more 
  advanced than FMOD 3's function.  It has the following benefits.
  - Allows 128,256,512,...,16384 sized FFT windows.
  - Allows FFT window filtering such as rectangle/triangle/hanning/hamming/
    blackman/blackman-harris to obtain more accurate frequency information.
  - Allows per speaker analysis, so each speaker of a stereo signal can 
    be analyzed individually.
  - Doesn't need any initialization flags to enable.  Just call it.
+ Added user created sound support.  Create user streams or samples with 
  System::createSoundEx.
+ Added ability to 'rip' PCM sound data from sounds by simply supplying
  a read/seek callback in System::createSoundEx as you would with a user 
  created sound.  Can also be used to overwrite data FMOD reads as it is 
  loading.
+ System::setFileSystem now works.
+ Added createusersound example.
+ Added playsound example.

- Fixed 2d software mixed sounds only being 0 or full volume when 
  Channel::setVolume was used in conjunction with System::update.
- Fixed hang on sounds opened as samples with FMOD_SOFTWARE | FMOD_NONBLOCKING.
- Fixed crash on FMOD_SOFTWARE based sounds when a channel was used twice.
- Fixed click of FMOD_SOFTWARE based sounds when looping or for 
  FMOD_CREATESTREAM | FMOD_SOFTWARE based sounds.
- All plugins now around 4k smaller each.
- Fixed channel management bugs to do with virtual channels stealing.

* API changes, variables and functions renamed / moved.
* Changed DLL exports to be stdcall again.  Symbols are not stdcall mangled 
  though so it should make delphi / VB headers easier.

7/09/04 4.00.05 ALPHA
---------------------

+ Added FMOD_OPENONLY.  This opens a sound, but doesnt read or prebuffer it.  
  Useful for quick opens.
+ Added Sound::readData.  In conjunction with the above, a user can use it to 
  read and decompress sound data into their own buffer.
+ Added FMOD_CDDA_FORCEASPI and FMOD_CDDA_JITTERCORRECT flags to mode bits.
+ Added lcc-win32 import libraries.
+ More documentation.

- Fixed plugins not working correctly due to incorrect calling convention.
- Fixed 3D software mixed streams not allowing frequency or volume to be set on
  them.
- Removed FMOD_DONTPREBUFFER.  (use FMOD_OPENONLY instead).

* Sound::getLength now returns length in samples, length in milliseconds, and
  length in bytes instead of just length in samples.

3/09/04 4.00.04 ALPHA
---------------------

+ Channel::setCallback support added, currently only FMOD_CHANNEL_CALLBACK_END 
  supported.
+ More documentation.

- FMOD_SOFTWARE based sounds now allowed to be loaded, even if 0 is specified 
  in maxsoftwarechannels in System::init.  (which turns off the software mixer).
- Fixed FMOD_SOFTWARE static sounds not playing the last few samples of a sound.

30/08/04 4.00.03 ALPHA
----------------------

+ Tag support added.
+ More examples.
+ More documentation.
+ Added support for weirder extensible multichannel multibitformat .wav files.
+ Addition Equivalent of "FSOUND_FORCEMONO" from FMOD 3, but is automatic!  No 
  flags needed by the user, 3d stereo sounds are automatically downmixed, and
  with far greater efficiency than fmod3.

- CDDA fixes.
- Panning fixes in software engine.
- 24bit sound / streaming / resampling and output support working properly.
- Streamer bugs fixed.

* Some API changes / renames / additions / removals.
* Software mixing / DSP engine overhaul and optimizations, now 2-3x faster and
  no dynamic memory allocation when playing sounds.
* Oscillator unit updated.
* System::getCPUUsage now ignores I/O time so CDDA support doesnt say it is 
  using 50% cpu when it is actually only using 1-2% :)

27/07/04 4.00.02 ALPHA
----------------------

+ Added Delphi headers
+ Added some more documentation.

26/07/04 4.00.01 ALPHA
----------------------

* Initial release
